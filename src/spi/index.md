# Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)

SPI stands for Serial Peripheral Interface. It's one of the most common ways for microcontrollers to talk to other devices like displays, sensors, and memory chips.

## Why SPI?

SPI is a great choice when you want fast and reliable communication between your microcontroller and a peripheral. It's much faster than IÂ²C or UART, simple to use, and allows data to be sent and received at the same time (full-duplex). This makes it ideal for high-speed devices like displays or SD cards. As long as you have enough GPIO pins and don't need to connect a large number of devices, SPI is usually the best tool for the job.

## How SPI Works

SPI communication involves a single master device (usually the microcontroller) and one or more slave devices (e.g., a sensor or display). The master initiates and controls all communication. The connection typically uses four lines:

- **SCK** (Serial Clock): Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data.
- **MOSI** (Master Out Slave In): Data sent from the master to the slave.
- **MISO** (Master In Slave Out): Data sent from the slave to the master.
- **CS** (Chip Select): Used by the master to choose which device to talk to.

Only one slave is active at a time. The master pulls the corresponding CS line low to begin communication, sends data over MOSI, and receives data over MISO. When done, it pulls CS back high to end the communication.

### SPI Modes

SPI supports four modes, numbered from 0 to 3. These decide when data is read and written depending on the clock's idle level and edge.

Don't worry too much about the details right now. Mode 0 is the most common and works with most devices.
