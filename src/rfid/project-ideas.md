# Project Ideas

## 1. Access Control with RFID and OLED

Build an access control system that displays "Access Granted" or "Access Denied" on an OLED display when RFID tags are scanned. Optionally, add a buzzer to provide audio feedback based on the access status.

### Components
- MFRC522 (RFID reader module) & RFID Tags/Cards
- 0.96-inch OLED Display (I2C interface)
- \[Optional\] Buzzer (for audio feedback)
- Power Supply (e.g., 5V adapter or battery)

## 2. Automatic Garage door using RFID

I found an interesting video that demonstrates an automatic garage door system using RFID with Arduino. You can replicate this project using an ESP32 and Rust. [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICnYGbvkrpo).

### Components
- MFRC522 (RFID reader module) & RFID Tags/Cards
- Servo motor
- \[Optional\] Buzzer (optional, for audio feedback)
- Power Supply (e.g., 5V adapter or battery)
