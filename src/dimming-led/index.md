# Dimming LED

In this exercise, we'll dim an external LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), which will be explained in the next chapter. Essentially, we control the LED's brightness by adjusting the duty cycle (explained in the PWM section), which varies at regular intervals to create a dimming effect.

## Hardware Requirements

- LED
- Resistor (330 Ohms)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Circuit
//TODO
