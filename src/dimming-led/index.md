# Dimming LED

In this exercise, we'll dim an external LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Before you begin, I recommend reading the [PWM and LED PWM sections](../core-concepts/pwm/index.md) in the Core Concepts chapter.


## Hardware Requirements

- LED
- Resistor (330 Ohms)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)

## Circuit
